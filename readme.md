## UTAG-UCC Welfare

The UTAG-UCC Welfare platform is a project commissioned by UTAG-UCC with a goal to digitize its activities.
The system provides a convenient and go-to point for all members to request and track and their membership benefits,
while affording the executives the ease of working on the request.

The system features:
- adding members, viewing their benefit requests
- adding, editing, tracking and acting on benefit requests for members
- charts and analytics for benefit requests and members
